# Measuring Spin-Echo with Earth Field Magnetic Resonance
This paper focuses on getting spin-echo measurements and possibly to calculate the hydrogen
content of a sample by making use of Earth field nucleic magnetic resonance, which is a kind of
low-field NMR. The main points that will be studied in this paper are the theory behind nucleic
magnetic resonance, explanation of the setup that will be used and how it is made and finally,
getting spin-echo measurements using this setup. The important emphasis in this project is to be
able perform these on a budget that can be afforded by undergraduate students.
